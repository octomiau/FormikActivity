# React Formik Login Component

This is a simple React component that demonstrates the usage of Formik for creating and validating a login form.

## 🌟Features:

- Uses the **Formik** library for handling form state and validation.
- Uses built-in browser email validation using the **pattern** attribute.
- Provides clear error messages for invalid input.
- Alerts the user upon successful form submission.

## 🔧 Installation:

1. **Ensure you have React and ReactDOM installed** in your project:

shCopy code

npm install react react-dom

1. **Install the Formik library** :

shCopy code

npm install formik

1. Import the **App** component from the provided code into your desired location and utilize it as needed.

## 🚀 Usage:

To use this component in your React app, simply import and render it:

```javascript 
import App from './path-to-component-file'; function YourComponent() { return ( \<div\> \<App /\> // ... other components or content \</div\> ); }
```

## 🔎 Code Details:

- The **formik** instance is created with **useFormik** hook.
- Initial values for **email** and **password** are set to empty strings.
- On form submission, the user is alerted if the login is successful. This is just a placeholder action, and you can replace it with your desired functionality, e.g., API calls, redirects, etc.
- The **validate** function checks if:
  - **email** is provided and if it matches a standard email pattern.
  - **password** is provided.

Error messages are displayed next to the respective input fields when validation fails.

## ⚠️ Known Issues:

- Although there's a pattern provided for email validation (using regular expressions), there seems to be a comment indicating an error in the console. This might need further debugging based on the actual error message.
